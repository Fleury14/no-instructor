    <h2 class="color-navyblue">Net Neutrality</h2>
    <p>The FCC is about to vote on rolling back the previously established rules for net neutrality. With the internet being such an important part of our everyday lives, this will have a huge effect on how we pay for and use the internet. A large portion of the general public, however, has no idea what these laws are and how this can effect them. The goal of this app would be to educate people on exactly what net neutrality is. </p>
    <h4 class="color-navyblue">App would include</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A layout of what the rules are as of the 2015 ruling</li>
        <li>A display of what the rules could be</li>
        <li>How this would effect our every day lives by giving examples of countries that don't stick to net neutrality (i.e. Spain, Portugal)</li>
        <li>The argument against NN presented in an objective fashion</li>
        <li>How a reader can effect change (i.e. contacting representatives)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="color-navyblue">Tech education</h2>
    <p>With technology becoming increasingly ubiquitous every year, current education should reflect that by educating children on safe practices with todays technologies, and things that kids need to look out for. Nowadays, the internet is the first place a child is left unsupervised, yet there is no preparation whatsoever for what a child experiences. This needs to change. We came up with two ideas targeted at middle school education.</p>
    <h3 class="color-navyblue">Educating middle schoolers through the app</h3>
    <p>This idea, admittedly the one as a group we seemed to prefer, would make the app an educational tool for children at the middle school level. The plan would be to create several games that simulate challenges that someone new to the internet would encounter that could cause harm unbeknownst to them. Examples would be picking out safe or unsafe simulated e-mails to recognize phishing scams, demonstrating dangerous ads that could lead to adware, and etiquette practice with people online.</p>
    <h3 class="color-navyblue">Targeting educators of middle school students</h3>
    <p>This approach is made for teachers and would detail a cirriculum that can be used in a middle school course. We believe that a tech class should be taught at the very latest at a middle school level, and we can outline important areas that should be covered, as well as giving a presentation on the more important subjects. The subjects would be similar to the ones mentioned above, but we would include more content as we would be outlining an entire cirriculum.</p>

    <h2 class="color-navyblue">Practical driving education</h2>
    <p>This idea stems from the notion that the current system of educating people is far too impractical for anyone that will actually be driving on a regular basis... which is just about everybody. The goal here is to educate people with driving tips that aren't taught in the normal driving education cirriculum, and emphasize things that are, but may not have been retained very well.</p>
    <h4 class="color-navyblue">App features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>An interactive animated demonstration of real-world scenarios that people will encounter, and how to approach them.</li>
        <li>A quiz that the user can take and afterwards be informed of answers they may not have been aware of. The goal isn't to get the highest score possible; it's to understand etiquette that they may not be aware of, such as slower traffic staying out of the left lanes.</li>
        <li>Explanations of common yet fairly dangerous situations that could lead to an accident</li>
        <li>A standard procedure for what happens when something goes wrong with your vehicle and you don't know what to do.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- begin budgeting -->
    <h2 class="color-navyblue">Personal budgeting application</h2>
    Maintaining a proper budget is becoming increasingly difficult due to the lard amount of subscription costs that are popping up everywhere are companies attempt to further monetize content. While there are plenty of heavy-duty financial programs to compile a complex analysis of a personals budget such as Quicken, our goal would be to complete a free, lightweight application in which people can input their income, list any and all recurring expenses, and have a visual presentation of how much disposable income they have, and how cutting certain subscriptions would affect their budget.
    <h4 class="color-navyblue">App features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Continuous input of income which would store amounts on a back end and give a projected average</li>
        <li>Prompt user for common recurring costs so they dont forget (i.e. health insurance, phone bill)</li>
        <li>Also prompt the user for less common subscriptions that are growing in number (i.e. game subscriptions, media contents subs, etc)</li>
        <li>Display not only what a personal budget looks like currently, but also project how it would look if there was a change of income, such as a raise, or if they added/removed subscriptions.</li>
    </ul>
